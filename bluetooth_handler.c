/* @section SPP Service Setup

 * @text To provide an SPP service, the L2CAP, RFCOMM, and SDP protocol layers 
 * are required. After setting up an RFCOMM service with channel nubmer
 * RFCOMM_SERVER_CHANNEL, an SDP record is created and registered with the SDP server.
 * Example code for SPP service setup is
 * provided in Listing SPPSetup. The SDP record created by function
 * spp_create_sdp_record consists of a basic SPP definition that uses the provided
 * RFCOMM channel ID and service name. For more details, please have a look at it
 * in \path{src/sdp_util.c}. 
 * The SDP record is created on the fly in RAM and is deterministic.
 * To preserve valuable RAM, the result could be stored as constant data inside the ROM.

/* @section Bluetooth Logic 
 * @text The Bluetooth logic is implemented within the 
 * packet handler, see Listing SppServerPacketHandler. In this example, 
 * the following events are passed sequentially: 
 * - BTSTACK_EVENT_STATE,
 * - HCI_EVENT_PIN_CODE_REQUEST (Standard pairing) or 
 * - HCI_EVENT_USER_CONFIRMATION_REQUEST (Secure Simple Pairing),
 * - RFCOMM_EVENT_INCOMING_CONNECTION,
 * - RFCOMM_EVENT_CHANNEL_OPENED, 
* - RFCOMM_EVETN_CAN_SEND_NOW, and
 * - RFCOMM_EVENT_CHANNEL_CLOSED
 */

/* @text Upon receiving HCI_EVENT_PIN_CODE_REQUEST event, we need to handle
 * authentication. Here, we use a fixed PIN code "0000".
 *
 * When HCI_EVENT_USER_CONFIRMATION_REQUEST is received, the user will be 
 * asked to accept the pairing request. If the IO capability is set to 
 * SSP_IO_CAPABILITY_DISPLAY_YES_NO, the request will be automatically accepted.
 *
 * The RFCOMM_EVENT_INCOMING_CONNECTION event indicates an incoming connection.
 * Here, the connection is accepted. More logic is need, if you want to handle connections
 * from multiple clients. The incoming RFCOMM connection event contains the RFCOMM
 * channel number used during the SPP setup phase and the newly assigned RFCOMM
 * channel ID that is used by all BTstack commands and events.
 *
 * If RFCOMM_EVENT_CHANNEL_OPENED event returns status greater then 0,
 * then the channel establishment has failed (rare case, e.g., client crashes).
 * On successful connection, the RFCOMM channel ID and MTU for this
 * channel are made available to the heartbeat counter. After opening the RFCOMM channel, 
 * the communication between client and the application
 * takes place. In this example, the timer handler increases the real counter every
 * second. 
 *
 * RFCOMM_EVENT_CAN_SEND_NOW indicates that it's possible to send an RFCOMM packet
 * on the rfcomm_cid that is include
